# Context Map

Primary context files:

- `context/overview.md`
- `context/architecture.md`
- `context/patterns.md`
- `context/glossary.md`

Feature/domain context:

- `context/cli/cli-command-surface.md` (CLI command surface including top-level help with ASCII art banner and gradient rendering, setup install flow, WorkOS device authorization flow + token storage behavior, attribution-only hook routing, setup-owned local DB bootstrap plus doctor local-DB health coverage, nested flake release package/app installability, and Cargo local install + crates.io readiness policy; `sce sync` command wiring is deferred to `0.4.0`; migrated runtime command structs for help/version/completion/auth/config/setup/doctor/hooks are owned by their respective `services/{name}/command.rs` files)
- `context/cli/default-path-catalog.md` (canonical production CLI path-ownership contract centered on `cli/src/services/default_paths.rs`, including persisted, repo-relative, embedded-asset, install/runtime, hook, and context-path families plus the regression guard that keeps production path ownership centralized)
- `context/cli/patch-service.md` (standalone patch domain model, parser, JSON load helpers, and set operations in `cli/src/services/patch.rs` for in-memory parsed unified-diff representation, capturing only touched lines plus minimal per-file/per-hunk metadata, supporting both `Index:` SVN-style and `diff --git` git-style formats, with `ParseError` for actionable malformed-input diagnostics, `PatchLoadError`/`load_patch_from_json`/`load_patch_from_json_bytes` for storage-agnostic JSON reconstruction, `intersect_patches` for target-shaped overlap with exact-match-first and historical `kind`+`content` fallback semantics, and `combine_patches` for ordered patch combination with later-wins conflict resolution; `intersect_patches` is consumed by the minimal agent-trace generator seam; not yet wired into CLI command dispatch)
- `context/cli/styling-service.md` (CLI text-mode output styling with `owo-colors` and `comfy-table`, TTY/`NO_COLOR` policy, shared helper API for human-facing surfaces, and per-column right-to-left RGB gradient banner rendering)
- `context/cli/config-precedence-contract.md` (implemented `sce config` show/validate command contract, deterministic `flags > env > config file > defaults` resolution order, canonical `$schema` acceptance for startup-loaded `sce/config.json` files, shared auth-key env/config/optional baked-default support starting with `workos_client_id`, shared runtime resolution for flat logging plus nested `otel` observability keys, canonical Pkl-generated `sce/config.json` schema ownership plus CLI embedding/reuse contract, config-file selection order, `show` provenance output, trimmed `validate` output contract, and opt-in compiled-binary config-precedence E2E coverage contract)
- `context/cli/capability-traits.md` (current broad CLI dependency-injection capability seam in `cli/src/services/capabilities.rs`, including `FsOps`/`StdFsOps`, `GitOps`/`ProcessGitOps`, git root/hooks resolution behavior, AppContext wiring, and test-only unimplemented stubs; current service internals do not consume these traits until later lifecycle migration tasks)
- `context/sce/cli-observability-contract.md` (implemented config-backed runtime observability contract for the flat logging + nested `otel` config-file shape with env-over-config fallback, concrete logger/telemetry runtime behavior plus logger and object-safe telemetry trait boundaries, AppContext observability wiring, operator-facing `sce config show` observability reporting, and the trimmed `sce config validate` status-only validation surface)
- `context/sce/shared-context-code-workflow.md`
- `context/sce/shared-context-plan-workflow.md` (canonical `/change-to-plan` workflow, clarification/readiness gate contract, and one-task/one-atomic-commit task-slicing policy)

- `context/sce/dedup-ownership-table.md` (current-state canonical owner-vs-consumer matrix for shared SCE behavior domains and thin-command ownership boundaries)

- `context/sce/atomic-commit-workflow.md` (canonical manual-vs-automated `/commit` contract, including the single-message rule, the staged-plan commit-body requirement to cite affected plan slug(s) + updated task ID(s), and automated single-commit execution behavior)

- `context/sce/agent-trace-embedded-schema-validation.md` (implemented internal Agent Trace JSON schema-validation seam in `cli/src/services/agent_trace.rs`, embedding `config/schema/agent-trace.schema.json` at compile time, caching the compiled validator, validating string or parsed-JSON inputs, and returning deterministic invalid-JSON vs schema-validation errors without changing the current minimal generator output)
- `context/sce/agent-trace-schema-adapter.md` (historical Agent Trace adapter reference for the removed `cli/src/services/agent_trace.rs` surface)
- `context/sce/agent-trace-payload-builder-validation.md` (historical Agent Trace builder/validation reference for the removed runtime surface)

- `context/sce/agent-trace-minimal-generator.md` (implemented library-only minimal agent-trace generator seam at `cli/src/services/agent_trace.rs`, producing a JSON payload with top-level `version`, UUIDv7 `id` derived from commit-time metadata, caller-provided commit-time `timestamp`, and per-file trace data from patch inputs via `intersect_patches(constructed_patch, post_commit_patch)` then `post_commit_patch`-anchored hunk classification into `ai`/`mixed`/`unknown` contributor categories, serialized per conversation as nested `contributor.type` plus one derived `ranges[{start_line,end_line}]` entry per post-commit hunk)
- `context/sce/agent-trace-hooks-command-routing.md` (implemented `sce hooks` command routing plus current runtime behavior: disabled-default commit-msg attribution, no-op `pre-commit`/`post-commit`/`post-rewrite` entrypoints, and `diff-trace` STDIN intake with required-field validation plus collision-safe `context/tmp/<timestamp>-000000-diff-trace.json` persistence)
