# SCE doctor operator environment contract

## Scope

Task `sce-doctor-operator-environment` `T01` defines the approved contract for broadening `sce doctor` from hook-readiness validation into the canonical installed-CLI operator health and repair entrypoint for SCE.
This document is the implementation target for `T02` through `T07` in that plan.

In scope for this contract task:

- operator-environment readiness semantics for installed CLI, global SCE state, and repo-scoped rollout state
- deterministic problem taxonomy, severity/fixability classes, and remediation metadata
- stable text/JSON output additions for diagnosis and `--fix` reporting
- the standing maintenance rule that every new SCE-managed setup/install surface must extend `sce doctor` coverage in the same change stream

Out of scope for this contract task:

- Rust implementation changes
- parser/help wiring beyond the contract needed for downstream tasks
- broad machine diagnostics unrelated to SCE-owned operator readiness

## Current implementation baseline

The runtime in `cli/src/services/doctor/mod.rs` exposes the approved doctor command surface and stable output-shape scaffolding, with focused `doctor/{inspect,render,fixes,types}.rs` submodules separating diagnosis, rendering, fix execution, and doctor-owned domain types. The `doctor` command now aggregates `ServiceLifecycle::diagnose` and `ServiceLifecycle::fix` calls across registered service providers (`config`, `hooks`, `local_db`). Together they cover the global-readiness slice plus the current repo-integrity, database-inventory, and repair slices:

- explicit mode selection through `sce doctor` (`diagnose`) and `sce doctor --fix` (`fix`)
- command/help wiring for `--fix` plus stable text/JSON mode reporting
- human text rendering with `SCE doctor diagnose` / `SCE doctor fix` header + ordered `Environment`, `Configuration`, `Repository`, `Git Hooks`, and `Integrations` sections
- exact human text status vocabulary `[PASS]`, `[FAIL]`, and `[MISS]`
- text summary footer with blocking-problem and warning counts
- local DB reporting in default doctor output
- stable problem records with category, severity, fixability, and remediation metadata
- deterministic fix-result records in fix mode with `fixed`, `skipped`, `manual`, and `failed` outcomes
- simplified `label (path)` human rows for healthy path-backed state/config/repository/hook entries, without redundant `present` / `expected` prose
- default global/local config-file location reporting, plus validation of existing global and repo-local `sce/config.json` readability and schema compliance (delegated to `ConfigLifecycle::diagnose`)
- startup config resolution no longer blocks doctor on invalid default-discovered config files; doctor reaches its own config-validation path, reports those files as problems, and keeps invalid-config remediation manual-only
- local DB location reporting, DB parent-directory readiness checks, and existing-DB health validation (delegated to `LocalDbLifecycle::diagnose`)
- local DB reporting in default doctor output
- explicit git-unavailable, outside-repo, and bare-repo repository-targeting failures
- effective hook-path source (`default`, local `core.hooksPath`, global `core.hooksPath`)
- repository root and hooks directory resolution when a repository target is detected
- top-level-only human text hook rows for `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `post-commit`, with nested `content` / `executable` detail removed from text mode
- required hook presence and executable permissions for `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `post-commit` when repo-scoped checks apply (delegated to `HooksLifecycle::diagnose`)
- byte-for-byte stale-content detection for required hook payloads against canonical embedded SCE-managed hook assets (delegated to `HooksLifecycle::diagnose`)
- repo-root installed OpenCode integration inventory for `OpenCode plugins`, `OpenCode agents`, `OpenCode commands`, and `OpenCode skills`
- integration child-row reporting for those four groups now validates file content against embedded SHA-256; missing files render as `[MISS]`, content mismatches render as `[FAIL]`, and any affected parent group renders as `[FAIL]`
- repo-root OpenCode plugin inventory includes the installed manifest file plus plugin/runtime/preset artifacts as required presence-only files; generated `config/.opencode/**` trees are not inspected by doctor
- repair-mode delegation to `ServiceLifecycle::fix` implementations: `HooksLifecycle::fix` reuses `install_required_git_hooks` for missing hooks directories plus missing, stale, or non-executable required hooks; `LocalDbLifecycle::fix` and `AgentTraceDbLifecycle::fix` handle bootstrap of missing canonical SCE-owned DB parent directories

## Approved human text-mode contract

Plan `doctor-human-text-integration-audit` task `T01` locks the approved human-facing `sce doctor` text contract for downstream implementation tasks.
This section is now implemented by the current runtime and remains normative for future changes.

### Text-mode section order

Human text output for `sce doctor` must render these sections in this exact order:

1. `Environment`
2. `Configuration`
3. `Repository`
4. `Git Hooks`
5. `Integrations`

### Human text status vocabulary

Human text rows must use exactly this status vocabulary:

- `[PASS]`: healthy
- `[FAIL]`: SCE will not work unless fixed
- `[MISS]`: required file is missing

No alternate human text status labels are allowed for this layout.

When shared CLI color output is enabled, `[PASS]` renders green and `[FAIL]` / `[MISS]` render red.
When color is disabled, human text still renders the exact bracketed tokens without ANSI sequences.

### Header and row formatting

Diagnose mode renders the header `SCE doctor diagnose`.
Fix mode renders the header `SCE doctor fix`.

Human text rows with path detail use the simplified `label (path)` form.
Healthy human rows do not append redundant prose such as `present`, `expected`, or `all required files present`.

Repository rows use the labels `Repository` and `Hooks` in text mode.

### Git Hooks text simplification

Human text output for `Git Hooks` is simplified to top-level required-hook presence rows only.
Nested human text rows for hook `content` or `executable` detail are not part of the approved layout.
This simplification is text-mode only and does not change JSON output requirements.

### Integrations text contract

Human text output for `Integrations` must use exactly these groups:

- `OpenCode plugins`
- `OpenCode agents`
- `OpenCode commands`
- `OpenCode skills`

Integration checks for this contract inspect installed repo-root artifacts only.
They validate file presence and content hashes against embedded OpenCode assets.
Generated `config/.opencode/**` trees are out of scope for doctor integration checks in this change stream.

For `agents`, `commands`, and `skills`, the installed repo-root trees are required inventory.
If any required file in an integration group is missing or mismatched:

- missing child rows render `[MISS]`
- mismatched child rows render `[FAIL]` and include a content-mismatch detail
- the parent integration group renders `[FAIL]`

An integration group renders `[PASS]` only when every required installed file in that group is present.

Healthy integration parent rows render the group name only.
Integration child rows render as `[STATUS] relative/path (absolute/path)` in text mode.

### Non-goals for this contract slice

- no JSON output shape or semantic changes
- no `sce doctor --fix` behavior changes
- no Claude integration content validation
- no new integration group names

## Command surface contract

- Canonical operator command: `sce doctor`
- Canonical explicit repair mode: `sce doctor --fix`
- Stable output modes: text (default) and `--format json`

Default `sce doctor` behavior remains diagnosis-only and read-only.
`sce doctor --fix` is the only canonical repair path and may perform only safe, idempotent repairs bounded to SCE-owned paths/files or explicit permission normalization on those paths.

`sce doctor --fix` must not:

- delete unrelated files
- overwrite unknown config without explicit SCE ownership rules
- mutate git config unexpectedly
- repair non-owned or ambiguous targets without deterministic refusal guidance

## Readiness model

`sce doctor` reports one top-level readiness verdict for the inspected operator environment:

- `ready`: no blocking SCE operator issues were detected
- `not_ready`: one or more blocking issues were detected

The readiness verdict covers three check domains:

1. installed CLI/runtime identity
2. global SCE state/config/DB readiness
3. repository and hook rollout readiness when repo-scoped checks are applicable

Repo-scoped issues make readiness `not_ready` only when a repository target is required for the inspected surface. Non-repo global checks must still run and report deterministically when `sce doctor` is executed outside a git repository.

## Problem taxonomy

Every detected issue must map to exactly one stable problem category:

- `runtime_identity`: installed binary/runtime metadata or command-surface problems
- `global_state`: global state-root, config-path, config-contents, or local DB readiness problems
- `repository_targeting`: repository resolution, git availability, bare-repo, or hooks-path discovery problems
- `hook_rollout`: missing, partial, stale, non-executable, or otherwise unhealthy required SCE-managed hooks
- `repo_assets`: missing or stale repo-local SCE-managed assets outside the hook files themselves
- `filesystem_permissions`: missing parent directories, unwritable owned paths, rename/temp barriers, or permission failures blocking safe repair
- `remediation_coverage`: gaps where doctor can diagnose an issue but does not yet own a canonical repair path

Each problem record must also include stable severity and fixability classes.

### Severity classes

- `error`: blocks readiness and requires repair or explicit manual action
- `warning`: non-blocking but operator-visible risk, drift, or partial-state concern that must still surface in output
- `info`: non-failure contextual guidance that helps explain status or next actions

### Fixability classes

- `auto_fixable`: safe for `sce doctor --fix` to repair idempotently
- `manual_only`: not safe for automatic repair; output must include deterministic manual remediation
- `not_yet_implemented`: intended to become auto-fixable, but current doctor repair coverage is incomplete and must report the gap explicitly

## Required check inventory

The broadened contract for `sce doctor` must cover the following problem inventory.

### Installed CLI/runtime identity

- binary/runtime metadata is incomplete or inconsistent
- installed build does not expose the expected SCE command surface
- required runtime directories cannot be resolved on the current platform

### Global SCE state/config readiness

- global SCE state root cannot be resolved
- expected global config path cannot be resolved
- global config file exists but is unreadable, invalid JSON, or fails schema validation
- invalid default-discovered config must not prevent `sce doctor` from starting; doctor still reports invalid global or repo-local config as a problem once command dispatch begins
- local DB or Agent Trace DB path cannot be resolved
- DB parent directories are missing or not writable
- DB bootstrap or migration health is broken

### Repository targeting and git readiness

- repo-scoped checks are required but `sce doctor` is run outside a git repository
- `git` is unavailable or repository inspection commands fail
- repository root resolution fails or resolves unexpectedly
- repository is bare or unsupported for local hook rollout
- effective hooks directory cannot be resolved
- local or global `core.hooksPath` points to a missing or unexpected location

### Hook rollout integrity

- effective hooks directory is missing
- required SCE hooks are missing
- required hooks exist but are not executable
- required hook payloads differ from the canonical embedded SCE-managed content
- only some required hooks are current, producing a partial rollout
- hook files have launcher, shebang, or path issues that prevent reliable execution
- adjacent rewrite/runtime guidance required for healthy rollout is missing from operator output

### Repo-installed SCE assets

- expected repo-local `.sce/` state/config directories are missing when the repair path needs them
- installed repo-facing SCE assets are missing or stale relative to canonical embedded assets
- prior setup was only partially applied

### Filesystem and permission barriers

- effective hooks directory is not writable for repair
- repo-local `.sce/` directory is not writable for repair
- global state/config/DB parent directories are not writable
- remove-and-replace safety cannot proceed because temp, rename, or write permissions fail

### Remediation coverage gaps

- doctor detects an issue but does not map it to one canonical SCE repair action
- an issue is safely auto-fixable but no internal `doctor --fix` repair path exists yet
- an issue is not auto-fixable and needs deterministic manual remediation guidance in text/JSON output

## Remediation contract

Every reported problem must include deterministic remediation metadata:

- whether the issue is `auto_fixable`, `manual_only`, or `not_yet_implemented`
- one canonical next action (`doctor_fix`, `setup_hooks`, `manual_steps`, or another stable action label introduced by downstream tasks)
- concise human-readable remediation text in text mode
- stable machine-readable remediation fields in JSON mode

When an issue is `manual_only`, `sce doctor` must return explicit manual steps instead of vague diagnostics.
When an issue is `not_yet_implemented`, output must say that doctor recognizes the issue but does not yet own an automatic repair path.

## `--fix` execution contract

`sce doctor --fix` must report deterministic per-problem repair results using this outcome vocabulary:

- `fixed`: doctor repaired the issue successfully
- `skipped`: doctor intentionally left the issue unchanged because it was already healthy or did not require action
- `manual`: doctor identified the issue but it requires manual remediation
- `failed`: doctor attempted an allowed repair but the repair did not complete successfully

Repair behavior must:

- delegate to `ServiceLifecycle::fix` implementations for service-owned repairs (`ConfigLifecycle`, `HooksLifecycle`, `LocalDbLifecycle`)
- reuse existing canonical SCE repair flows when ownership already exists, especially `sce setup --hooks` semantics and shared setup/security helpers
- add new internal doctor-owned repair routines only for safe gaps with no existing canonical repair command
- stay idempotent across repeated `--fix` runs
- remain bounded to SCE-owned paths/files and explicit permission normalization on those paths

## ServiceLifecycle trait

The `ServiceLifecycle` trait in `cli/src/services/lifecycle.rs` provides a unified interface for service health checks, repairs, and setup:

- `diagnose(&self, ctx: &AppContext) -> Vec<HealthProblem>`: returns health problems detected by the service
- `fix(&self, ctx: &AppContext) -> Vec<FixResult>`: attempts to repair issues detected by the service
- `setup(&self, ctx: &AppContext) -> Vec<SetupOutcome>`: performs service-specific setup steps

Default implementations are no-ops, allowing services to opt-in to lifecycle ownership incrementally.

Services implementing `ServiceLifecycle`:
- `ConfigLifecycle` in `cli/src/services/config/lifecycle.rs`: validates global/local config readability and schema compliance
- `HooksLifecycle` in `cli/src/services/hooks/lifecycle.rs`: checks hook rollout integrity, required-hook presence/executability/content
- `LocalDbLifecycle` in `cli/src/services/local_db/lifecycle.rs`: validates DB path/health, bootstraps DB parent directory
- `AgentTraceDbLifecycle` in `cli/src/services/agent_trace_db/lifecycle.rs`: validates Agent Trace DB path/health, bootstraps DB parent directory

The `doctor` command aggregates `diagnose` and `fix` across all registered providers.
The `setup` command aggregates `setup` across all registered providers in order (config → local_db → agent_trace_db → hooks).

## Output shape contract

Text and JSON output must both expose:

- command identity and inspection mode (`diagnose` or `fix`)
- readiness verdict
- inspected environment summary across runtime/global/repo domains
- stable problem records with category, severity, fixability, and remediation guidance
- `--fix` result reporting when repair mode is used

The JSON contract must remain stable enough for downstream automation and include machine-readable problem and fix-result records rather than free-form diagnostics only.

## Setup and doctor alignment rule

Doctor/setup alignment is a standing repository contract, not a one-off for hook rollout.

Every newly added SCE-managed setup/install surface must define, in the same change stream:

- what `sce doctor` checks for that surface
- how readiness changes when that surface is missing, stale, partial, or misconfigured
- whether each new issue class is `auto_fixable`, `manual_only`, or `not_yet_implemented`
- which canonical repair action owns remediation
- which durable context files describe the resulting current-state contract

No new SCE setup/install capability is considered complete until matching `sce doctor` readiness and remediation coverage is defined and synchronized in context.

## Downstream verification targets

The implemented doctor command is verified through parser/help tests, doctor-focused service tests, and final repository verification.
The current validation baseline proves deterministic coverage for output shape, readiness transitions, diagnosis-only safety, supported `--fix` repairs, refusal paths for unsafe repairs, and setup-to-doctor alignment for newly managed surfaces.
