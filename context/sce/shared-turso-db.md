# Shared Turso Database Infrastructure

`cli/src/services/db/mod.rs` provides the shared Turso database adapter seam for CLI services that need local Turso-backed persistence.

## Contract

- `DbSpec`: service-specific database metadata.
  - `db_name()` returns a human-readable diagnostic name.
  - `db_path()` resolves the canonical database file path.
  - `migrations()` returns ordered embedded migration `(id, sql)` pairs.
- `TursoDb<M: DbSpec>`: generic adapter that owns:
  - tokio current-thread runtime creation
  - Turso local database open/connect flow
  - parent-directory creation
  - synchronous `execute()`, `query()`, and row-mapping `query_map()` wrappers
  - generic embedded migration execution through `run_migrations()` with per-database `__sce_migrations` metadata
- Shared lifecycle helpers:
  - `collect_db_path_health()` emits common parent/path health problems for DB-backed services.
  - `bootstrap_db_parent()` creates the resolved DB parent directory for repair/setup flows.

## Current integration state

The shared module is exported from `cli/src/services/mod.rs` and compile-checked. Current concrete wrappers:

- `cli/src/services/local_db/mod.rs`: `LocalDb = TursoDb<LocalDbSpec>`, with `LocalDbSpec` resolving `local_db_path()` and declaring zero migrations.
- `cli/src/services/agent_trace_db/mod.rs`: `AgentTraceDb = TursoDb<AgentTraceDbSpec>`, with `AgentTraceDbSpec` resolving `agent_trace_db_path()` and loading ordered Agent Trace migrations for `diff_traces` and `post_commit_patch_intersections`.

Both database wrappers now have lifecycle providers. `lifecycle_providers(include_hooks)` registers database providers in order `LocalDbLifecycle` → `AgentTraceDbLifecycle` before optional hooks, so setup initializes both databases and doctor diagnoses/fixes both canonical DB paths.

## Migration metadata

`TursoDb<M>::run_migrations()` creates a service-local `__sce_migrations` table before applying migrations. Each migration is skipped only when its ID is already recorded in that table; otherwise the SQL is executed and the ID is recorded after success.

Existing databases created before migration metadata are upgraded by re-applying the current idempotent migration list and recording each migration ID. This lets later `sce setup` / lifecycle initialization runs apply migrations added after the database file already existed, including Agent Trace DB schema/index additions.
